# OpenSCM-Calibration-examples

Long-running examples using OpenSCM-Calibration

To do:

- test notebooks (follow https://semaphoreci.com/blog/test-jupyter-notebooks-with-pytest-and-nbmake#h-pre-requisites or use nbval, it really depends whether we want to write assertions by hand or just make sure the output is the same each time and I don't know the answer there yet)
